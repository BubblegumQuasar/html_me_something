		<p class="paragraph">
		As is true of most knitters and crocheters, I have just a ridiculous yarn stash. I've never met a fibercrafter
		who had a hoard that took up less than one giant Rubbermaid tote bin. Having inherited bunches, I had several totes
		worth, and a one-bedroom apartment. As you can imagine, space is an issue.

		I had, by chance, stumbled upon an image of a <a href="https://knitsforlife.com/2013/03/26/the-worlds-best-yarn-storage-idea/">
		California yarn shop's</a> method of organization while on Reddit (&copy; Reddit, because not mine), and was
		instantly hooked (I promise I'll try not to make too many crochet puns).

		So first, I had to construct the wall. I opted for an 8x4 white pegboard and realized immediately that its structure
		was insufficient to support its own weight, so I needed to build a frame, which meant I also needed to purchase a mitre saw,
		drill, and masonry bit (for my cinderblock wall). Thankfully, construction went rather smoothly.

		Lastly, I had to get the yarn on the wall. I had not considered what a feat this was going to be, given that most
		yarn comes in skeins, and it needed to be in cakes. Two electric winders (because those things break with a quickness), a manual
		winder, and a lot of blisters later, I had everything in cakes.

		<h4 class="header4">The Finished Product!</h4>
		<p class="paragraph">
		This isn't a perfect representation, as the wall has had much yarn added since its construction, but here
		is how it looked new. I'm pretty pleased with it, even if the wall behind it will require some TLC when I move out.
