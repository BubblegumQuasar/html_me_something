		<h4>On yarn organization in general...</h4>
		<p>
		As is true of most knitters and crocheters, I have just a ridiculous yarn stash. I've never met a fibercrafter
		who had a hoard that took up less than one giant Rubbermaid tote bin. Having inherited bunches, I had several totes
		worth, and a one-bedroom apartment. As you can imagine, space is an issue.

		I had, by chance, stumbled upon an image of a Canadian yarn shop's method of organization while on Reddit, and was
		instantly hooked (I promise I'll try not to make too many crochet puns).
